### Architecture

AlgoBridge is an oracle based bridge between algorand and avalanche. 

Three main architectures are:
- AlgoBridge-Avax: It contains bridge and liquidity contracts in solidity as well as the oracle interactions.
- AlgoBridge-Algorand: It contains PyTeal liquidity and bridge contracts for oracle interactions.
- Oracle solution: This script keeps in sync between the two chains to release the corresponding tokens.
